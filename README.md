## Quintupple Portfolio

This is my Spigot plugin portfolio from over the past couple years. I have worked on other plugins not shown in this, but haven't been used by the servers intended as they have shut down. The projects have been deleted, so there is not much in this portfolio but I still have experience.
I am experienced in HTML, CSS, Java, Spigot API, and C#.

        Latest Plugins: Obscurus Classes, Magical Money.

        Older Plugins: Talert, Staff-Chat, Erised-Channels.

I also make websites, which can be seen in my other repository: **https://github.com/Quintupple/portfolio**
